# 🛡️ Microsoft Entra
## 🎯 Scenario: Block all countries except UK

**Background:**  

An accountancy firm identified multiple unauthorized sign-in attempts originating from foreign IP addresses. To reduce the risk of account compromise, a geolocation-based access control policy was required.

## ✅ Lab Objective  
By branding your organization’s Microsoft 365 sign-in experience, users can visually confirm they are on the real company login portal:

- Add countries locations to include UK as trusted site
- Setup conditional access policy to block all countries except UK
- Use a VPN connection to simulate a sign-in from a non-UK location.
- Create a security group in Entra ID for approved exception users.
- Test exception, reattempt the sign-in from a non-UK VPN location and confirm the user is allowed access as expected.
